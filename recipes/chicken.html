    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>The star of this Asian-style dish is the incredibly flavorful pan sauce drizzled over our seared chicken, which you'll make 
        by cooking fragrant fresh ginger with a savory-sweet mix of miso paste, honey, and butter. A bed of fluffy jasmine rice 
        (finished with rich sesame oil) is the perfect accompaniment to soak up all of the delicious, saucy bites.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><em>2</em> Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li><em>1/2 lb</em> Broccoli</li>
        <li><em>1/2 cup</em> Jasmine Rice</li>
        <li><em>2 cloves</em> Garlic</li>
        <li><em>1 Tbsp</em> Sweet White Miso Paste</li>
        <li><em>2 Tbsps</em> Butter</li>
        <li><em>1 Tbsp</em> Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li><em>1 Tbsp</em> Sesame Oil</li>
        <li><em>1</em> 1-Inch Piece Ginger</li>
        <li><em>2 tsps</em> Honey</li>
        <li><em>1 tsp</em> Black & White Sesame Seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients & start the sauce:</strong> Remove the <strong>honey</strong> from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place 
            an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450Â°F. Wash and dry the <strong>broccoli</strong>. Cut off and discard the 
            bottom 1/2 inch of the stem; cut the broccoli into small florets. Peel and roughly chop <strong>2 cloves of garlic</strong>. Peel and 
            finely chop the <strong>ginger</strong> to get 1 teaspoon (you may have extra). In a bowl, whisk together the <strong>miso paste, vinegar, honey</strong> 
            (kneading the packet before opening), and <strong>1/4 cup of water</strong>. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cook & finish the rice:</strong> In a small pot, combine the <strong>rice, chopped garlic, a big pinch of salt,</strong> and  
            <strong>1 cup of water</strong>. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 12 to 
            14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Stir 
            in the <strong>sesame oil</strong>. Cover to keep warm.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Roast the broccoli:</strong> Meanwhile, place the <strong>broccoli florets</strong> on a sheet pan. Drizzle 
            with <strong>olive oil</strong> and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 14 to 
            16 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Meanwhile, pat the <strong>chicken</strong> dry with paper towels; season with salt 
            and pepper on both sides. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat <strong>2 teaspoons of olive oil</strong> 
            on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. 
            Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Finish the sauce & serve your dish:</strong> Add the <strong>chopped ginger</strong> to the pan of reserved 
            fond (if the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil). Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 
            minute, or until slightly softened. Add the <strong>butter</strong> and <strong>sauce</strong> (carefully, as the 
            liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until combined and the 
            butter is melted. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Slice the <strong>cooked 
            chicken</strong> crosswise. Serve the <strong>sliced chicken</strong> with the <strong>finished rice</strong> and 
            <strong>roasted broccoli</strong>. Top the chicken with the <strong>finished sauce</strong>. Garnish with the 
            <strong>sesame seeds</strong>. Enjoy!</li>
