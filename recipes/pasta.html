    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Sometimes a simple pasta just hits the spot. This pasta is super easy to make and works well as a side dish, or a main dish 
        if you throw in some more protein!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 | bunch of collard green leaves, about 10-12 leaves</li>
        <li>8 oz | spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>2 tbsp | olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp | pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 tbsp | ginger, grated or chopped finely</li>
        <li>Zest from 2 lemons</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and boil the spaghetti noodles. Cook and set aside</li>
        <li>De-stem the collard greens and chop the collards into small pieces, no more than 1/2 inch wide.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the pine nuts, until they are a nice golden brown color, turning frequently. Set aside when done.</li>
        <li>Using the same skillet over medium heat add 1 tbsp of olive oil and the ginger to the pan. Allow the ginger to simmer until fragrant then add in the collard greens and the lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Cook the greens until they are mostly tender, about 5 minutes, turning frequently.</li>
        <li>In the pot that the noodles were cooked, or the skillet combine all the ingredients; pasta, pine nuts, and collard mixture. Add more olive oil one tsp at a time, until the pasta is nice and oiled, but not adding more than 3 tsp total.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste and add Parmesan on top and serve!</li>
    </ol>
